        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in the local IE area in which I attended Rialto High School to receive my high school diploma. During my years at RHS I made many friendships and learned life lessons. However, due to the criminal activity in the community my parents made the executive decisions that I was prohibited from staying after school unless it was absolutely meant for my education. Because of this rule I was not allowed to enter any sports, clubs, or any other extracurricular activity. This hindered my experiences as a student because I was not able to explore my interest with other students during free time. This did allow me to focus more on my studies rather than creating connections. During my studies I did manage to branch out to some of my other teachers to discuss my interest in education. Two of my high school teachers had recommended I explore Business as an educational and career goal.<br><br>

        Because of my extra free time I was able to spend more time on the internet making international connections with other people in the same age range as me. This led me to discover Graphic Design, specifically fan based graphics. These graphics consisted of book covers, banners, profile pictures, and other graphics. People would exchange them in shops like a business for recognition, followers, and reads on their own personal work. I started doing graphics in 2015 and have been an active member in multiple communities to this day. Due to this experience I have been able to become an intermediate user of Photoshop and other photo based applications. I have also been able to explore art medians and color theories from my work.<br><br>

        I became an outstanding member in some of these communities that I eventually held an online class in which I showed others how to make graphics at an advanced level. I made many friends and connections in these communities that have allowed me to learn a skill outside of education and outside on my campus.
